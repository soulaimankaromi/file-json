Exercise: Handling JSON files in Python

1. Create a c JSON file named "data.json" with the following content:
json
{
   "name": "John",
   "age": 25,
   “city”: “Paris”
}


2. Write a Python program that reads the "data.json" file and then displays the contents of the file as a dictionary.

3. Edit the program to add a new key-value to the dictionary, for example "language": "Python".

4. Save the modified dictionary in the “data.json” file.

5. Edit the program to display the contents of the "data.json" file after editing.

Note:
Use the json.loads function to load the contents of a JSON file in Python.
Consider manipulating JSON files using Python's json libraries.
Use the json.dumps function to save a dictionary to a JSON file in Python.
